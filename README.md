Overview
---
This project was done as an assignment for the Udacity course "Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree". The purpose of the code in this project is to identify the lane lines in images/videos taken from inside a moving car and transform the image/video such that the lane lines are clearly marked.

The code can be tested using the images in the folder "test_images" and the videos in the folder "test_videos". The output images/videos can be seen in the "test_images_output" and "test_videos_output" folders.
